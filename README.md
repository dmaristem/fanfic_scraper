# fanfic_scraper
Background: 
Fanfiction.net, a recreational website that allows writers to display their written work based off of the universes of (usually) published authors. Due to issues related to fanfiction users copying the work of other fanfiction users, fanfiction.net has disabled the copying option on its desktop version. While fanfiction might have a bad reputation due to the existence of terrible writing, there are well-written works of fiction out there, and those are the ones that will be the focus of this project. 

Note: 'fanfic' refers to a fanfiction story 

Problem: 
1) Fanfiction.net disables the copy option on its desktop version.
2) Some authors delete their stories. 

Goal: 
Given the link to a fanfic, save the fanfic as a .docx or .pdf file.

-Python
