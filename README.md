# fanfic_scraper
Background: 
Fanfiction.net is a recreational website that allows writers to display their written work based off of the universes of (usually) published works/media. Here 'fanfic' refers to a fanfiction story.  

Problem: 
1) Fanfiction.net disables the copy option on its desktop version.
2) Some authors delete their stories. 
As it is, I cannot copy and paste a story that I enjoyed reading into a Word Document, to save for future re-reading. 

Goal: 
Given the link to a fanfic, save the fanfic as a .docx or .pdf file.  

Note: This is for the preservation of selected works of fiction that I deem to be exceptional, not for any replication and distribution of other people's creative output for my own profit.
