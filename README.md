# fanfic_scraper
Background: 
Fanfiction.net is a recreational website that allows anyone to write stories in the universes of (usually) published works/media. Here 'fanfic' refers to a fanfiction story.  

Problems: 
1) Fanfiction.net disables the copy option on its desktop version.
2) Some authors delete their stories. 
3) Need to automate the action of saving a story, and scale it so that any number of stories can be saved automatically. Copying and pasting is really inefficient anyway. 

Goal: 
Given the link to a fanfic, save the fanfic as a .docx or .pdf file, for future re-reading.   

Note: This is for the preservation of selected works of fiction that I deem to be exceptional, not for any replication and distribution of other people's creative output for my own profit.
